title: About
---

I grew up using Mac OS on 68K and early Power Macintosh computers. When I
went to university I used Windows 98 and built myself several websites:
a home page, PIC microcontroller page, and TI-89 websites. These were all
coded by hand in HTML4.

[TODO: screenshots of old sites]

When I saw [Ruben's Retro Corner] I was inspired to build my own.
The website is built using HTML4 markup that should work fine on
90's era computers. To that end all pages on `www.7bit.org` are accessible
over plain HTTP.

Breaking from the era the site is built with
{% https(href="https://www.getzola.org/") %}Zola{% end %}, a current day static
site compiler.

I have tested the site using Netscape _n_ and Internet Explorer _n_ on
my Power Macintosh 9500. Check out the [computers page](@/computers.md) for more information
on my old computers.

I built this site using an offline copy of the Web Design Group's HTML 4.0 Reference
that was shipped with BBEdit 5.1. You can find at
`Infinte HD : Developer : BBEdit 5.1 : BBEdit Documentation : HTML Reference : HTML 4.0 Reference`
on {% https(href="https://infinitemac.org/1997/Mac%20OS%207.6") %}Infinite Mac{% end %}.
Amazingly the Web Design Group's resources are still online today. Check them out at:
{% https(href="https://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/") %}www.htmlhelp.com{% end %}.

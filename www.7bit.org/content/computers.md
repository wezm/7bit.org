My retro computers.

## Power Macintosh 9500/120

The Power Mac is currently running Mac OS 8.6. It is able to access the network
and wider internet over Wi-Fi by plugging its Ethernet into a Gl.iNet travel
router.

## Macintosh 128K (upgraded)

I was given this Mac 128K by a friend of my Dad's. It is an original Macintosh that
was upgraded to the equivalent of a 512Ke at some point. This means it has 512K of
RAM and 128K ROMs.

I use a [FloppyEmu] emulating a HD20 hard drive to boot it and transfer software.
